Before you get started:
> Make sure you download Python (anything before version 3.12)
  > Select "Install launcher for all users (recommended) and "Add Python [your version] to PATH, then either install or click "Customize Installation"
    > If you clicked "Install":
      > Reopen the installation file and select "Modify", then select all of the features, if possible
  > Hit "Next" and select all the advanced options (top to bottom) up until "Precompile standard library"
  > Install

> Install arcade (a library)
  > Open the Python terminal and type "pip install arcaade" (no quotes)

We used PyCharm by JetBrains to run arcade and our python code.
Thanks!
